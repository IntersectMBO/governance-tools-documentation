# GovTool - a breakdown of the costs so far

## Early Bootstrapping: Pre-CIP-1694 Approval

Before CIP-1694 was approved, GovTool was bootstrapped to help users visualize and test the proposed governance process. This phase was sponsored by IOG and delivered in collaboration with two builder teams.

* Initial development ( Core features and initial UX): \~$50K
* End-to-end automated testing (GovTool + CIP-1694 use cases): \~$20K

## Post-CIP-1694: Foundation and Expansion (Jan–Jun 2024)

Following the approval of CIP-1694 and Intersect’s official role, development was directed by the Governance Tools Working Group, utilizing a distributed builder model and community-reviewed grants.

## Summary

Initial costs were high due to the innovative nature of GovTool — a platform designed from scratch to serve a governance model that had never been implemented before. However, recent figures are a more accurate reflection of ongoing costs to maintain and evolve a live, multi-network governance system.
