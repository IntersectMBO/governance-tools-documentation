# Proposed roadmap

Cardnao Govtool direction and roadmap is community driven, both directly, via feedback and direct contribution, and more simply follows community’s priorities over time as governance evolves.&#x20;

You can see key planned (as well as delivered) initiatives here[ https://tinyurl.com/4275j7w4](https://t.co/msEkcwvj5i).&#x20;

Because Govtool’s roadmap is directly defined by the Cardano community, so subject to change and evolution, the best place to check what's coming next is the community backlog[ https://tinyurl.com/dt84eyek](https://t.co/zbmLzWicEV) and the community discussion (recently started to make it easier to define direction)[ ](https://t.co/KX5OroIeX1)[https://tinyurl.com/34fs6nz3](https://tinyurl.com/34fs6nz3) .



## Initiatives that have clear community support

Below is a list of initiatives that have shown to have community support from feedback collected in calls, on X and directly on github, so are currently being refine and prepared for implementation.\


* Add DRep history on the DRep page. This will show what that DRep voted on, how and (if available) with what rationale. Furthermore it will show the delegations moving in and out. All this will provide better context to the delegator, also opening new options to sort and filter DReps. [https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool/discussions/3895](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool/discussions/3895)&#x20;
* Add voting history on Governance Actions (both those up for voting and those that have been ratified or rejected). This will allow DReps and ADA holders to see directly on the Governance Action page, alongside all the context coming from the metadata, the details related to voting, making it easier also to see if their DRep voted as they expected, thus enabling liquid democracy. [https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool/discussions/3888](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool/discussions/3888) [https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool/discussions/3896](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool/discussions/3896)&#x20;
* Add support to easily create group DReps. This will enable smaller DReps to easily come together and build strong coalitions so further distributing voting power. Alongside this, add support to allow group DReps to use Govtool. [https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool/discussions/1761](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool/discussions/1761)&#x20;
* Add support for group proposers. Creating a Governance Action with multiple authors is a very hard challenge, with many opportunities for mistakes. Making it easier for multiple authors to submit a Governance Action will foster the creation of more governance actions, provide more clarity on-chain about where the proposal comes from, it will allow to divide the cost of the Governance Action deposit, hence lowering the barrier for participation to the global community.
* Add general support for multisig wallets. This will expand the pool of participants that will benefit from a simpler experience. The features is currently proposed to be implemented with an integration with ‘Mesh’. [https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool/discussions/3866](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool/discussions/3866)&#x20;
* Add Constitutional Committee vote details on Governance Actions (both those up for voting and those that have been ratified or rejected). This will make it easier to see which constitutional committee voted on a specific Governance Action and why they voted in that way, all on the same page.
* Add option for anyone to open surveys and polls to DReps and SPOs. This will make it easier to have pre-onchain governance sentiment checks. The effort here is related to the creation of a standard for off-chain polling that all tools can use. [https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool/discussions/3791](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/govtool/discussions/3791)&#x20;
* Ability to submit more than one vote in one transaction. This will make it easier for DReps to vote during times when many governance actions are on-chain
* Further expand open APIs coverage to include access to submission for all types of governance actions. This will make it easier for other builders to include this critical feature faster, drammatically lowering the barriers to submit a governance action.&#x20;
* Generally expand options for individual contribution to the open source code. Specifically integrate the GitHub backlog with the Andamio platform to allow anyone to get onboarded to the repos and be rewarded for meaningful contribution to key identified issues
* Optimise the hosting and deployment infrastructure to reduce cost and make general maintainance more efficient
