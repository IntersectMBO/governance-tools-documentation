# Read the Interim Constitution

The Constitutional Committee Portal is the place to view the most up to date in-force copy of the Cardano Constitution (currently showing the Interim Constitution).

In addition to the constitution you can use a table of contents in the sidebar, which allows you to navigate between sections of the Interim Constitution.&#x20;
