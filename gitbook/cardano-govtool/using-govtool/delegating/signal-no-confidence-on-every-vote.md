# Signal "No Confidence" on Every Vote

This option is where you effectively use your Voting Power to have GovTool **Signal 'No confidence'**, in the constitutional committee, and also **vote 'NO' on all proposals and vote 'YES' on all no-confidence proposals**. You would do this if you have lost confidence in the Constitutional Committee and want it to be replaced.
