# DReps

DReps (Delegated Representatives) are ADA holders who registered On-Chain to allow other members of the community to delegate their voting power to them, so that they can vote on their behalf. They are are like 'parlimentary representatives' in the Governance system.

Any ADA holder can become a DRep. They simply need to register on GovTool (or other platform).

DReps are defined by [CIP-1694](https://www.1694.io/). They can:

* Submit Governance Actions
* Review and submit votes on active Governance Actions
* Accept delegated Voting Power from any ADA holder

When a DRep votes on a Governance Action, they vote with all the [Voting Power](../../faqs/what-is-voting-power.md) that is delegated to them.
