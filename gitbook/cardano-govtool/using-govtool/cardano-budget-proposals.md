# Cardano Budget Proposals

## Overview

The Budget Proposals section is a space for the Cardano community to submit proposals they want to be included in the next Cardano budget. By submitting them here proposers will be able to get comments and feedback from ada holders and DReps.

## How to use this section

In the Budget Proposal section, you can:

* Review and comment on existing proposals
* Submit, edit, or delete your own proposals
* \[coming soon] If you are a DRep you can provide your sentiment about that proposal via a simple poll
* \[coming soon] If you are a member of the Intersect Committees you can provide recognisable feedback
