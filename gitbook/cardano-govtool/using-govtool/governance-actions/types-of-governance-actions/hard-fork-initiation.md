Note:

There are many varying definitions of the term "hard fork" in the blockchain industry. Hard forks typically refer to non-backwards compatible updates of a network. In Cardano, we formalise the definition slightly more by calling any upgrade that would lead to _more blocks_ being validated a "hard fork" and force nodes to comply with the new protocol version, effectively obsoleting nodes that are unable to handle the upgrade.
