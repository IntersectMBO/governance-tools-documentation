# Using Govtool

GovTool can be used in the following ways:

* View [Governance Actions](governance-actions/) with or without connecting a wallet
* Vote on Governance Actions directly by becoming a [Direct Voter](direct-voting.md).
* Become a [**DRep**](../faqs/what-is-a-drep.md) **(**&#x44;elegated Representative). DReps are able to vote on Governance Actions, they can also accept delegated Voting Power from others. A DRep's total Voting Power is the sum of their wallet balance and the Voting Power from others delegating to the DRep.
* Delegate [Voting Power](../faqs/what-is-voting-power.md) to a DRep. This is a way for users that don't want to vote themselves to choose a representative to vote on their behalf
* See results of Voting on Governance Actions. This is available to any public user.
* Propose a Governance Action&#x20;
* Participate in discussions on proposed Governance Actions.
