# Verification for Budget Proposals, Proposals, and discussions

## What's this all about?

GovTool has several layers of identification and security to help people user the Proposals areas. These are in place to help people participate in discussions, and to make sure that GovTool users can be securely verified by requesting a signed transaction with a connected wallet.

## Display Names

GovTool uses Display Names as a simpler way to recognise a commenter in our discussion forums. To use the forums, it is currently mandatory to create a Display Name. GovTool does not require any personally identifiable information (such as a email address, etc) to create a Display Name.

The Display Name needs to be created just once, and is not changeable once it's set. In other words, it is bound to the wallet that's attached.

You will be asked to create a Display Name on the first time you either:

* Create a Budget Proposal.
* Create a Proposal for a Governance Action.
* Participate in the discussion forums for Budget Proposals or Governace Action Proposals.

## Verification of users by signing transactions

To enable GovTool to clearly identify users on the discussion forums and Proposal areas, the first time a user either proposes a new Budget or Governance Action Proposal, or participates in a discussion forum, they will be required to sign a transction in their wallet. This identification of the users persists for the length of the user session. In other words, if you close your browser and come back, it's likely that you will be asked for another signing to re-identify yourself. There is no charge for this.

## For DReps

GovTool actualises a unique statue for DReps, in that they can comment on Budget Proposals and Governace Action Proposals with a DRep tag next to their comments. To enable this function, DReps must sign an additional transaction in their wallet to confirm their DRep key.&#x20;

DReps currently will be identified by their Display Name (see above) and not their DRep name in the comments. This is a limitation of the architecture of GovTool, and the GovTool team is looking for a way around this to display the DRep name instead.
