# Getting started

### To run GovTool, you need:

* A Chromium Browser.
* A Windows or Apple computer.&#x20;
* A compatible wallet. Please see the [compatible wallet list](compatible-wallets.md).

### Step-by-step instructions

1. Download a [compatible wallet](https://docs.sanchogov.tools/how-to-use-the-govtool/getting-started/get-a-compatible-wallet)
2. Create an account in your wallet. Please refer to the wallet's documentation to create an account.
3. Set your wallet's network to "Preview". This will be different for each wallet. Refer to the documentation of your wallet.
4. Get some test ADA from the Cardano testnet [faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet/).
5. Navigate to [https://preview.gov.tools/](https://sanchogov.tools/)
6. [Connect your wallet](connect-your-wallet-to-govtool.md) to GovTool.
7. You now have several options:
   1. [Browse on-chain Governance Actions](../governance-actions/vote-on-governance-actions/).
   2. [Vote on an action by becoming a dRep](../dreps/register-as-a-drep.md).
   3. '[Abstain](../governance-actions/vote-on-governance-actions/)' on every Governance Action by default.
   4. [Vote "No"](../governance-actions/vote-on-governance-actions/) on every action by default.
   5. [Become a dRep](../dreps/register-as-a-drep.md) yourself, and gain voting rights.
   6. Become a [Direct Voter](../direct-voting.md) and vote on Governance Actions with your own Voting Power
   7. Propose your own [Governance Action](../governance-actions/propose-a-governance-action.md)
      1. Note: The [Bootstrapping](../../faqs/bootstrapping-phase.md) phase will support only the creation of 'Info' Actions.
      2. GovTool on [SanchoNet](https://sanchogov.tools) currently supports 'Info' and 'Treasury' actions. Using SanchoNet will require you to change the network your wallet is connected to to "SanchoNet".
