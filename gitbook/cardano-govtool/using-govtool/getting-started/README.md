# Getting started

### To run GovTool, you need:

* A Chromium Browser.
* A Windows or Apple computer.&#x20;
* A compatible wallet. Please see the [compatible wallet list](compatible-wallets.md).

### Step-by-step instructions

1. Download a [compatible wallet](https://docs.sanchogov.tools/how-to-use-the-govtool/getting-started/get-a-compatible-wallet)
2. Create an account in your wallet. Please refer to the wallet's documentation to create an account.
3. If you want to use the Preview network:&#x20;
   1. Set your wallet's network to "Preview". This will be different for each wallet. Refer to the documentation of your wallet.
   2. Get some test ADA from the Cardano testnet [faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet/).
   3. Navigate to: [https://preview.gov.tools/](https://preview.gov.tools/)
4. To use the MainNet version of GovTool, go to: [https://gov.tools](https://gov.tools)
5. [Connect your wallet](connect-your-wallet-to-govtool.md) to GovTool by using the "Connect" buttons on the interface.
6. You now have several options:
   1. [Browse on-chain Governance Actions](../governance-actions/vote-on-governance-actions/).
   2. [Vote on an action by becoming a dRep](../dreps/register-as-a-drep.md).
   3. '[Abstain](../governance-actions/vote-on-governance-actions/)' on every Governance Action by default.
   4. [Vote "No"](../governance-actions/vote-on-governance-actions/) on every action by default.
   5. [Become a dRep](../dreps/register-as-a-drep.md) yourself, and gain voting rights.
   6. Become a [Direct Voter](../direct-voting.md) and vote on Governance Actions with your own Voting Power
   7. Propose your own [Governance Action](../governance-actions/propose-a-governance-action.md)
      1. Note: The [Bootstrapping](../../faqs/bootstrapping-phase.md) phase will support only the creation of 'Info' Actions.
      2. GovTool on [SanchoNet](https://sanchogov.tools) currently supports 'Info' and 'Treasury' actions. Using SanchoNet will require you to change the network your wallet is connected to to "SanchoNet".
