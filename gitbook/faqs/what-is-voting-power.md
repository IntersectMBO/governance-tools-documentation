# What is Voting Power?

For ada holders voting power refers to the amount of ada they own. For registered DReps Voting Power refers both to the voting power they own and to the voting power that other ada holders have delegated to them.

Voting Power is calculated at the end of every epoch. When a Voter casts a Vote in GovTool, the Votes are also tallied only at epoch boundaries.
