# Cardano Govtool Consortium

Cardano Govtool is a set of open source tools created for the public good to ensure ADA holders will always have a non-commercialised, non-privatized way to participate freely and transparently in Cardano's governance.

To allow the community members and builders who actively participate in the maintenance and development of these tools to act as one a consortium was created.
