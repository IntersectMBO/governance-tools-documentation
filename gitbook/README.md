# What is GovTool?

GovTool is an application that enables users to participate in many ways in the governance of the Cardano blockchain.

### GovTool enables any user to:

* View [Governance Actions](using-govtool/govtool-functions/governance-actions/) on the Cardano blockchain without connecting a wallet.
* View a list of [DRep](using-govtool/govtool-functions/dreps/)s that are registered on the blockchain.
* See results of [Governace Action votes](using-govtool/govtool-functions/governance-actions/governance-actions-how-to-vote/).

### GovTool enables ADA holders to:

* View [Governance Actions](using-govtool/govtool-functions/governance-actions/) with or without connecting a wallet.
* Register to vote ([Direct Voter](using-govtool/govtool-functions/direct-voting.md)) without becoming a DRep.
* [Delegate Voting Power](using-govtool/govtool-functions/delegating/delegate-to-a-drep.md) to a DRep
* Register to become a Delegated Representative ([**DRep**](using-govtool/govtool-functions/dreps/register-as-a-drep.md)), allowing others to delegate their voting power to the DRep.
* [Vote on Governance Actions](using-govtool/govtool-functions/governance-actions/governance-actions-how-to-vote/) - available to users that are registered to vote as DReps or Direct Voters.
* See results of [Governace Action](using-govtool/govtool-functions/governance-actions/) votes.
* [Propose](using-govtool/govtool-functions/governance-actions/propose-a-governance-action.md) a Governance Action.

Governance tooling is owned and maintained by the community. With community approval, Intersect, through its committees and working groups, will play an important role in hosting and maintaining these governance tools. Through active community involvement, the aim is to create the initial Governance foundation layer together with different builders in the community.&#x20;

These governance tools will support the whole process, both off-chain and on-chain, and as a whole they will support the implementation of the governance described in CIP-1694 and its adoption. Once this foundation layer is ready, the community will be able to further contribute to these tools by maintaining and improving existing features and pillars, creating new features or completely new areas either by themselves or supported by awards and grants facilitated by Intersect.

With the freedom to test and refine Cardano’s next era of governance principles under one central apparatus, GovTool helps the Cardano community forge a future governance framework that represents the community’s best democratic interests.
