# Direct Voting

Direct Voting is where any ADA holder can vote on any Governance Action. To be eligible to vote, you must register:

1. You will need ADA in a compatible wallet ([see list of compatible wallets](../getting-started/compatible-wallets.md))
2. Your ADA balance in your wallet must be large enough to cover a 500 ADA deposit (which is refundable) plus any transaction fees - (currently less than 0.2 ADA)
3. Click on "Register" in the "Become a Direct Voter" panel on the Dashboard to get started\
   ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/become a direct voter.png>)&#x20;
4. Follow the prompts to register. You will simply be asked to sign a transaction.
5. Wait a few minutes.
6. When the transaction is completed on the chain, the dashboard will change to show that you are registered to vote.
7. You can now vote on any [Governance Action](governance-actions/)
