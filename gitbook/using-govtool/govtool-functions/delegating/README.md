# Delegating

Delegating is the act of 'loaning' your Voting Power - which equals ADA the balance in your wallet - to someone else. The person or organisation that you delegate to are called DReps, which is short for "Delegate Representatives". DReps represent you in a similar way as a parliamentary or congressional representative does in an analog government. Simply put, they vote on your behalf.

You can also use your Voting Power with 'Automatic' voting options: These special options are for voting 'Abstain',  or voting "No Confidence" on all proposals. These options are similar to DReps in that they vote for you.&#x20;

The main functions of Delegating:

### **Delegate to DRep**

To delegate your personal Voting Power to someone else, who has registered previously as a dRep.&#x20;

### **Signal No Confidence**

Is where you use your Voting Power to Signal _'No confidence'_, in the constitutional committee, and also _vote 'no' on all proposals and vote 'yes' on all no-confidence proposals._ You would do this if you have lost confidence in the Constitutional Committee and want it to be replaced.

### **Vote ABSTAIN by default**

This option will show that you have participated in Governance, but you are not supporting a yes or no vote on proposals. Your Voting Power, however, will count towards a quorum on all votes.&#x20;
