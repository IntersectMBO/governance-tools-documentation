# Governance Actions

Governance Actions are the core elements that make up governance on the blockchain. They can be proposed by anyone that has ADA in their wallets, but are subject to a (refundable) deposit upon submission. The main document for describing these actions is [CIP-1694](https://www.1694.io/). You can read the entirety of Cardano Governance in this document.&#x20;

There are seven types of Governance Actions (see full description: [SanchoNet governance actions](https://sancho.network/actions/))&#x20;
