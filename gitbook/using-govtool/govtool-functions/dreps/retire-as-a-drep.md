# Retire as a DRep

If a DRep no longer wants to participate in Governance, they can opt to retire. Retiring means that a DRep gives up voting rights. Voting Power that is delegated to the DRep will remain in place, i.e. will still be 'delegated' to the DRep's ID.

ADA Holders that have delegated to be able to see that a DRep is retired in the DRep directory. They will be able to re-delegate their Voting Power to another DRep.

Retired DReps can still participate in Governance by proposing Governance Actions, by delegating their personal Voting Power to another DRep, or by coming out of retirement, and assuming their previous role as a DRep.

If a DRep comes out of retirement, their DRep ID will be the same as it was before retirement, and their Voting Power will consist of their own ADA balance and what delegated power that is associated â€¨to your DRep ID.
