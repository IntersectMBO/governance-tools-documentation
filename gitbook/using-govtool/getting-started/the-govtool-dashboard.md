# The GovTool Dashboard

The dashboard allows you to access all the functions of GovTool. You can:

1. <mark style="color:purple;">**Delegate your Voting Power to a DRep, who will vote as your proxy**</mark>
2. <mark style="color:red;">**Vote on your own without delegating to a DRep**</mark>
3. <mark style="color:blue;">**Propose a Governance Action (ADA deposit required: Refunded upon completion of voting or expiry of voting period)**</mark>
4. <mark style="color:green;">**Become a DRep and enable delegation to yourself, which increases your Voting Power**</mark>
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**View and Vote on Governance Actions**</mark>
