# Testing GovTool

## Why are we beta testing?

Voltaire GovTool will be one of the first tools that allows ADA holders to experience the CIP-1694 governance on Cardano. The current version of this tool has been developed using initial feedback from the community and following what's described in CIP-1694. It's now important that the community tests this tool and provide valuable insights to further refine it and make it ready for future product use.

## ⚠️ Known issues

* DRep registration metadata form not CIP-119 compliant
