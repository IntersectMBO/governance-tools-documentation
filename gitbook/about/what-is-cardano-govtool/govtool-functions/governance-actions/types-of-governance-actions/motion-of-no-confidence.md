# Motion of No Confidence

### A motion to create a _state of no-confidence_ in the current Constitutional Committee.&#x20;

The constitutional committee is considered to be in one of the following two states at all times:

1. A normal state (i.e. a state of confidence)
2. A state of no-confidence

In a _state of no-confidence_, the current committee is no longer able to participate in governance actions and must be replaced before any governance actions can be ratified.

To pass, this Action requires:

<table><thead><tr><th width="278">Constitutional Committee</th><th>DReps</th><th>SPOs</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Doesn't Vote</td><td>67%</td><td>51%</td></tr></tbody></table>

These values could be changed via a new Government Action. To see the current values at any time, you can view [https://cardanoscan.io/protocolparams](https://cardanoscan.io/protocolparams).
