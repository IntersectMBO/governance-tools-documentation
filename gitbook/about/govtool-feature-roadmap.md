# GovTool feature roadmap

The Intersect Product team, together with the community builders who are developing GovTool  will release improvements and new features while empowering the community to participate in its development, maintenance, and improvement.

## Roadmap

**Multi-language Support**

This will provide a simple way for community members to add translations and it will provide support, as a foundation, to key languages.\
\
An Intersect grant will be awarded to support this work.

**Governance Actions Outcomes**

This will be the last foundational pillar of Govtool completing support for the entire governance process.\
\
This will show the history of Governance Actions that have been ratified or rejected.

An Intersect grant will be awarded to support this work.
