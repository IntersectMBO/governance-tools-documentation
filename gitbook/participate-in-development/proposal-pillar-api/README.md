# Proposal Pillar API

GovTool's backend services are primarily focussed on reading governance data from Cardano, and showing this to users. Although the APIs for these services are open with a general policy builders are not encouraged to use these, as these are specialised for GovTool and maybe changed without notice.

GovTool's Proposal Discussion Pillar is an off-chain forum, to discuss and propose ideas that may become governance actions. This off-chain data is generated by GovTool and cannot be queried by chain indexing. This is why Intersect/GovTool commits to allowing builders/tooling providers to use the Proposal Pillar API.
