# Overview

The Cardano governance tools are fully open-sourced with an Apache 2.0 license.

This ensures these tools are owned and maintained by the Cardano community itself via Intersect committees and working groups.

Contracts for core maintainers are in place to ensure the Cardano GovTool and the Constitutional Committee Portal (the core governance tools) are fully supported and maintained and to ensure contribution to those is easy for individuals. The current maintainers are:

* [Byron Network](https://www.linkedin.com/company/byron-network/): Cardano GovTool Voting and Delegation pillar
* [DQuadrant](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dquadrant/): Cardano GovTool end-to-end testing
* [Bloxico](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bloxico/): Constitutional Committee Portal
* [WeDeliver](https://www.linkedin.com/company/we-deliver-it/): Cardano GovTool Proposal discussion pillar
* [Lido Nation](https://www.lidonation.com/en): Cardano GovTool Outcomes pillar
